THIS IS A FUNCTION THAT WILL SAY NAMES
======================================

this function will call you the names that you will pass into it.


::

	>>> say_my_name = __import__('3-say_my_name').say_my_name
	
	>>> say_my_name("John", "Smith")
	My name is John Smith

If we pass only one argument int our function, it will only say one name

::

	>>> say_my_name("Bob")
	My name is Bob

If the one of the arguments is not a string, we will get a TypeError

::

	>>> say_my_name(1, "Fab")
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: first_name must be a string

::

	>>> say_my_name("Fab", 3)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: last_name must be a string
