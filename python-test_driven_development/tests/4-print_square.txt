a function that prints a square with the character #
====================================================

HOW IT WORKS
============

this function will take the size as the argument, and both height and width will be equal to that size


::

	>>> print_square = __import__('4-print_square').print_square
	
	>>> print_square(4)
	####
	####
	####
	####

If zero is passed to the function, the function will print nothing

::

	>>> print_square(0)
	
	
If size is less than zero, a ValueError will be raised

::

	>>> print_square(-2)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	ValueError: size must be >= 0

If size is not an integer, a TypeError will be gotten

::

	>>> print_square('fab')
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: size must be an integer

If size is a float and is less than zero, a TypeError will be gotten

::

	print_square(-3.2)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: size must be an integer

::

	print_square()
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: print_square() missing 1 required positional argument: 'size'
